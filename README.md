####Downloading and compiling

    git clone https://github.com/lh3/alktk.git
    (cd alktk; gcc -g -O2 -Wall -lz -o alktk alktk.c)

####Generating .alk files

ALK files are generated with a special version of samtools, which has not been
pushed to the official github as a lot of development is happening there. The
command line is:

    bcftools view -cuI -K out.alk in.bcf > /dev/null 2>&1

####Viewing .alk files

    alktk cat -t in.alk      # output entire file
    alktk cat -tp in.alk     # only print positions and the reference allele frequency

####Subsetting .alk files

    alktk sites in.alk in.srt.list > out.alk

where `in.srt.list` is a TAB delimited file with each line consists of 1) index
of the chromosome, 2) position and 3) whether the reference allele in the
original .bcf is the ancestral allele. This file must be position sorted. Alktk
requires the 3rd column as the original .bcf only carries information about the
reference allele. An example of `in.srt.list` is:

    1   123456  0
    1   234567  1
    2   12345   0

####Estimating AFS with EM

    alktk afs in.alk > iter-1.txt
    alktk afs in.alk iter-1.txt > iter-2.txt
    alktk afs in.alk iter-2.txt > iter-3.txt

Here `in.alk` is typically the .alk on a list of sites, generated by `alktk
sites`. Each `afs` command does one round of EM. The output gives the ancestral
allele frequency.
